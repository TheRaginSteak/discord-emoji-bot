# discord-emoji-bot

A bot to do various tasks on Discord.

To use the SFX functionality, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) needs to be downloaded, and be able to be executed by the program. This can be done by putting the files in the /bin into the root of the bot's folder, or added to your system's PATH
